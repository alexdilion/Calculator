To update the display:
	Set the equation text to equal the first term

	If there is an operator:
		Append it to the equation text

	If there is a second term:
		Append it to the equation text

	If there is a result:
		Append an equals sign to the equation text
		Set the result text to equal the result

	If there is no result:
		Set the result text to an empty string

When the clear button is pressed:
	Reset all variables
	Set text in display to nothing

When a number button is pressed:
	If there is a result:
		Reset variables and display text

	If we are on the first term:
		Append to the first term
	Otherwise:
		Append to the second term

	Update display

When an operator is pressed:
	Change the current operator to the new one

	If firstTerm is empty then return

	If newEquation:
		Move onto the next term
	Else:
		Assign result to firstTerm
		Assign an empty string to secondTerm
		Assign an empty string to result
	
	Update display

When the equals button is pressed:
	Initiate x and y
	
	If there are no terms then return

	If there is no result:
		Assign number value of firstTerm to x
	Else:
		Assign number value of result to x
		Assign result to firstTerm
		Update display

	Set y to equal the parsed value of secondTerm

	If y is 0 and we are dividing:
		Alert the user
		Assign empty string to secondTerm
		Update display
		Return

	If there is no operator:
		Assign firstTerm to result
		Assign false to newEquation
		Update display
		Return
	
	Assign return value of operation to result
	Assign false to newEquation
	Update display
